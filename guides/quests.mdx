## How Rocks Are Distributed

At the end of each week (Monday 00:00:00 UTC), we calculate the number of quests completed by each user, divide it by the total completions for each quest, and apply the ratio to the Rocks bag allocated to that quest.

<Info>
  **Example**

  During the week, 3 users complete the Corner Dealer quest.

  The quest has a bag of 7,000 Rocks to be distributed at the end of the week.

  **User Completions**:
  - User 1: completed the Corner Dealer quest 4 times
  - User 2: completed the Corner Dealer quest 2 times
  - User 3: completed the Corner Dealer quest 1 time

  **Total Completions**: 7

  **Rock Distribution**:
  - User 1: 7000 × (4/7) = 4000 Rocks
  - User 2: 7000 × (2/7) = 2000 Rocks
  - User 3: 7000 × (1/7) = 1000 Rocks
</Info>

## Tracking Your Progress

The Profile Page includes two key sections to keep track of your achievements:

- **Leaderboard Tab**: See how you stack up against other users and challenge yourself to climb higher.
- **History Tab**: View a detailed log of each week you participated in and the corresponding Rocks earned.

Use these tools to strategize and set new goals each week!
